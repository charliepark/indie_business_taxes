Right now, I'm sitting at a dining room table full of receipts, papers, invoices, milers, wires, binders, and coffee. It's a mess. The goal? Not do this ever again.

I'm going to record what I need, and what I need to do to make it easier in the future. Automated e-mails will create a schedule that I'll follow. Weekly e-mails will let me know what's coming up down the road.
